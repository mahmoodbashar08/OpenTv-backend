 * Worker could be driven end to end without workerd, and 558 tests have been
 * shaping it since -- including the bound-parameter ceiling and the `batch()`
 * behaviour a first version got wrong. That makes it the most exercised
 * adapter in this repository, so the self-hosted container runs THIS rather
 * than a second implementation nobody would test and which would drift the
 * first time either was fixed.
 *
 * The harness imports it from here for exactly the same reason.

/**
 * The smallest honest D1 shim: `prepare().bind().run()/all()/first()` with
 * `meta.changes`. Synchronous underneath, async on the outside, exactly as D1
 * presents itself.
 *
 * `batch()` executes in order and does not roll back — the ordering is the half
 * the import endpoints actually depend on (the rollup statement's
 * `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guard must run before that item's insert), and atomicity
 * is D1's to provide.
 *
 * It also returns `results` for a SELECT, which D1 does and an earlier version
 * of this shim did not: it called `run()` on every statement and threw the rows
 * away. A batch of SELECTs would have come back as a row of empty envelopes,
 * and the first route to read a list through `batch()` would have been tested
 * against a lie.
