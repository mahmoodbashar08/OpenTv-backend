 * a count band over an empty page. For an app whose first act is importing
 * seven years of someone's writing, "your words are here, you may not read
 * them" is the wrong sentence to ship.
 *
 * THE SAME VISIBILITY RULES AS THE THREAD, to the letter: deleted, hidden, an
 * author whose account is gone, and a block in either direction all remove a
 * row here exactly as they do there. A profile must never become the back door
 * to a comment the thread would not show.
 *
 * REPLIES ARE NOT INCLUDED, and neither are they counted.
 *
 * They used to be, on the reasoning that they are things this person wrote. But
 * a reply is half of somebody else's conversation: torn out of its thread it
 * reads as a non-sequitur, and it drags a fragment of the parent's context onto
 * a stranger's screen. The owner's own Profile tab has always shown top-level
 * comments only, so a visitor also saw a number the owner could not reproduce —
 * 4 against their 2.
 *
 * `parent_id IS NULL` is the same test `getVisibleOwnComments()` makes on the
 * phone. One definition of "a comment on my profile", both ends.
