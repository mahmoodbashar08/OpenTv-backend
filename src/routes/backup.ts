/**
 * The library, kept somewhere that is not the phone.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, GIVEN THE WHOLE APP IS BUILT NOT TO NEED IT. The phone's
 * SQLite database is still the source of truth and nothing here changes that.
 * But a decade of watch history that exists on exactly one device is one
 * dropped phone away from gone, and iCloud and Google Drive each solve that for
 * half the users and neither solves it for somebody moving between the two.
 * This is the third destination, and it is the only one that crosses.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY STORED: one object per profile, overwritten in place — the
 * same TV Time-format ZIP `exporter.ts` builds, byte for byte, the same one
 * iCloud and Drive already hold. No new format, no server-side parsing, and no
 * watch-history TABLE: this server still cannot answer "what did they watch",
 * because the answer is a ZIP it never opens.
 *
 * ⚠️ STORED AS SENT, NOT ENCRYPTED BY US. The bytes travel over TLS and sit in
 * R2 at rest, but a copy of somebody's library is on this server, readable by
 * whoever holds the R2 credentials — which is a real change from "your library
 * never leaves your phone" and must be said plainly wherever it is offered.
 * That is why the whole feature is opt-in and off by default, why the settings
 * row says it in those words, and why `DELETE` below exists and is not gated on
 * anything. If this is ever encrypted on the device, only the phone changes:
 * this route already treats the body as opaque.
 *
 * PLUS GATES WRITING, NEVER READING. Uploading needs a subscription; getting
 * the copy back and deleting it do not. A backup that becomes unreachable when
 * a card expires is not a backup, it is a hostage — and the one promise this
 * project cannot break is that a user's own history is theirs.

 * It was per profile — `backups/<profileId>.zip`, overwritten in place — and

 * 21 Sep: the cloud copy went from a 1,260-episode library to a 1,042-episode
 * one and back again, twice, in an afternoon, because two devices at slightly
 * different sync states each believed they were backing up "the" library.
 *
 * It was survivable only because each device still had its own copy locally.
 * The case it was never survivable for is the one the feature exists for: a
 * THIRD device, restoring, taking whatever happened to be up there at that
 * second.
 *
 * So each device writes its own key and nothing overwrites anybody. Choosing
 * between them becomes a question with an answer instead of a coin toss — see
 * `pickBest`.
 *
 * The profile id still comes from the session and never from input. The device
 * id does come from input, so it is pattern-checked before it goes anywhere
 * near a key: it is a path segment, and a client that could put `../` in it
 * could write outside the prefix.
