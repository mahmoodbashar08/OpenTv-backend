/**
 * Signing in with an email address, for people who will not use Apple or

 *
 * A STRANGER MUST NOT LEARN WHETHER AN ADDRESS HAS AN ACCOUNT — everywhere it
 * costs nothing. "Forgot password" always answers 202; a wrong password and an
 * unknown address give the same 401 after the same work. An endpoint that says
 * "no such user" is a membership oracle: point it at a mailing list and it
 * tells you which of those people use this app, which for a TV tracker is a
 * list of what they watch.
 *
 * REGISTRATION IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is deliberate. It used to answer a
 * taken address exactly as a free one — "check your inbox" — and the cost fell
 * entirely on the honest majority: somebody whose address signs in with Google
 * pressed "Create account" and was sent to wait for a message that could not
 * help them. Now it names the providers already on the address, so the app can
 * say "use Google" and finish the job in one tap. What it concedes is that an
 * address has an account here — which the sign-in form would confirm to the
 * same person two taps later anyway.
 *
 * PASSWORDS NEVER APPEAR IN A URL, a log, or a response. See `passwords.ts`.
