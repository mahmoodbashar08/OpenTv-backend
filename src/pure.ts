 * title is touched by the change.
 *
 * The test vectors that pin the rule live in `test/pure.test.ts` here and must
 * exist identically on the app side (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md, "The shared
 * identity rule" — the table of eleven vectors).
 *
 * The single most important line in this file is the character class
 * `[^\p{L}\p{N}]+` with the `u` flag. An ASCII-only `[^a-z0-9]` would reduce
 * every Arabic title to the empty string and collapse the entire Arabic
