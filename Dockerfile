# the Worker already runs, so a build stage would exist only to produce a `dist`
# nobody reads. The image is Node, the source, and one native module.
#
# better-sqlite3 IS NATIVE, which is the only reason the base is not `-slim`
# without python3 and a compiler beside it. It has prebuilt binaries for common
# platforms and falls back to building; the build tools are dropped from the
# final image either way.

# the documented setup from a fresh clone rather than by reading it. It is also
